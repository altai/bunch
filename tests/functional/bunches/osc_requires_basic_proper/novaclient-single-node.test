Feature: Start instance(s) in single node deployment using  python-novaclient CLI
    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
    As tester
    I want to register start instance and verify it is up and available via SSH

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-network ! novaclient-images ! novaclient-keys"

    Scenario: Start single instance and bind with pre-uploaded keypair
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance1" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small" and keypair "test_key"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance1" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |

    Scenario: Start single instance and login with auto-generated root password
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance2" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small" and save auto-generated password
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance2" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance2" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance2" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" using saved password


    Scenario: Stop instances
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        When I stop VM instance "rhelinstance1"
        And I stop VM instance "rhelinstance2"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" is stopped within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance2" is stopped within "180" seconds
