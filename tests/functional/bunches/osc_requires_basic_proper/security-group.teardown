Feature: Change nova config to disable security groups
    In order to clean after test security-group functionality
    As tester
    I want to change nova config

    Scenario: Configure OpenStack compute
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            
            | libvirt |
            
            | mysql |
            
            | mysql-server |
            
            | rabbitmq-server |
            
            | openstack-nova-node-full |
            
            | MySQL-python |
            
            | euca2ools |
            
            | python-kombu |
            
        When I change flag file "/etc/nova/nova.conf" by removing flag values:
            | Name                      |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  |

        Then the following flags are not in "/etc/nova/nova.conf":
            | Name                      |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  |


    Scenario: Restart OpenStack services
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | messagebus |
            
            | rabbitmq-server |
            
            | mysqld |
            
            | libvirtd |
            
        When I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            


    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |
