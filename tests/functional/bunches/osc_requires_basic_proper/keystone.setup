Feature: Setup keystone on installed OpenStack
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As root
    I want to setup keystone

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-keys"

    Scenario: Install keystone
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            
            | libvirt      |
            
            | mysql      |
            
            | mysql-server      |
            
            | rabbitmq-server      |
            
            | openstack-nova-node-full      |
            
            | MySQL-python      |
            
            | euca2ools      |
            
            | python-kombu      |
            
        And every RPM package available:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        When I install RPM package(s):
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        Then every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |


    Scenario: Setup nova and glance to use keystone
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |

#        When I change flag file "/etc/glance/glance-api.conf" by setting flag values:
#            | Name               | Value                                                 |
#            | pipeline         | versionnegotiation authtoken auth-context apiv1app    |

#        And I change flag file "/etc/glance/glance-registry.conf" by setting flag values:
#            | Name               | Value                                  |
#            | pipeline         |  authtoken auth-context registryapp    |

        And I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/pipeline = versionnegotiation context apiv1app/pipeline = versionnegotiation authtoken auth-context apiv1app/' "/etc/glance/glance-api.conf"  |  noFail  |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/pipeline = context registryapp/pipeline = authtoken auth-context registryapp/' "/etc/glance/glance-registry.conf"  |  noFail  |
            |  sudo mv -f /etc/nova/api-paste.ini /etc/nova/api-paste.ini.wokeystone  | noFail    |
            |  sudo dd if=/etc/keystone/nova-api-paste.ini of=/etc/nova/api-paste.ini  | noFail    |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/999888777666/"111333555777"/' "/etc/nova/api-paste.ini"  |  noFail  |

        And I init keystone db for IP "172.18.40.10", admin "admin1", password "secrete", project "project1", token "111333555777", region "kRegion"

        And I start services:
            | ServiceName        |
            | keystone |
        And I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
        And every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
            | keystone |

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
            |  Command                            | Expected |
            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |
