Feature: Create user and project using python-novaclient CLI
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As cloud admin
    I want to create user and project

    Scenario: Create admin user
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
        When I create nova admin user "admin1"
        Then nova user "admin1" exists

    Scenario: Create project
        Given nova user "admin1" exists
        When I create nova project "project1" for user "admin1"
        Then nova project "project1" exists
        And nova user "admin1" is the manager of the nova project "project1"
