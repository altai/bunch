Feature: Remove keystone
    In order to clean environment after smoke test
    As root
    I want to remove keystone


    Scenario: Revert changes made to nova and glance
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        And every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
            | keystone |


        When I stop services:
            | ServiceName        |
            | keystone |
        And I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/pipeline = versionnegotiation authtoken auth-context apiv1app/pipeline = versionnegotiation context apiv1app/' "/etc/glance/glance-api.conf"  |  noFail  |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/pipeline = authtoken auth-context registryapp/pipeline = context registryapp/' "/etc/glance/glance-registry.conf"  |  noFail  |
            |  sudo mv -f /etc/nova/api-paste.ini /etc/nova/api-paste.ini.wkeystone  | noFail    |
            |  sudo cp -f /etc/nova/api-paste.ini.wokeystone /etc/nova/api-paste.ini  | noFail    |
            |  sudo rm -f /var/lib/keystone/keystone.db  | noFail    |
            |  sudo rm -rf /etc/keystone     | noFail    |

        And I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
