Feature: Install, start services and create virtual disk needed to test volume
    In order to test volume functionality
    As tester
    I want to install services

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-network ! novaclient-images ! novaclient-keys"


    Scenario: Install packages
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package available:
            | PackageName   |
            
            | scsi-target-utils |
            
            | lvm2 |
            
        When I install RPM package(s):
            | PackageName   |
            
            | scsi-target-utils |
            
            | lvm2 |
            
        Then every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            
            | scsi-target-utils |
            
            | lvm2 |
            

    Scenario: Start iscsi services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            
            | scsi-target-utils |
            
            | lvm2 |
            
        When I start services:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | tgtd |
            
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | tgtd |
            


    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected  |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |



#    Scenario: Clean after privious run
#        When I remove lvm group "nova-volumes" on device "/dev/loop4"
#    Scenario: Clean after privious run
#        And I remove loop device "/dev/loop4"


    Scenario: Create volume
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | tgtd |
            
        When I create loop device "/dev/loop4" in file "/tmp/loop4" with size "4" gigabytes
        And I create lvm group "nova-volumes" on device "/dev/loop4"
        Then I see loop device "/dev/loop4" available
        And I see lvm group "nova-volumes" on device "/dev/loop4" available


    Scenario: Start nova-volume services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            
            | scsi-target-utils |
            
            | lvm2 |
            
        And I see lvm group "nova-volumes" on device "/dev/loop4" available
        When I start services:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-volume |
            
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-volume |
