Feature: Test security groups
    In order to smoke test security group functionality
    As tester
    I want to start 3 instances in different security groups. Then allow traffic between 2 of them and check that allowed and disallowed traffic works as it should.



    Scenario: Add 3 security groups, check them added.
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see security group "smoketest" does not exist
        And I see security group "smoketest2" does not exist
        And I see security group "smoketest3" does not exist
        When I add security group "smoketest"
        And I add security group "smoketest2"
        And I add security group "smoketest3"
        Then I see security group "smoketest" exist
        And I see security group "smoketest2" exist
        And I see security group "smoketest3" exist


    Scenario: Add rules for me to access instances
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see security group "smoketest" exist
        And I see security group "smoketest2" exist
        And I see security group "smoketest3" exist

        When I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "smoketest"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "smoketest2"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "smoketest3"

        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "smoketest"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "smoketest2"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "smoketest3"

        Then I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "smoketest" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "smoketest2" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "22" in group "smoketest3" exist

        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "smoketest" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "smoketest2" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "172.30.252.1" to access port "" in group "smoketest3" exist

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |

    Scenario: Start instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance1" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small", keypair "test_key" in security groups "smoketest"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance1" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Start 2nd instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance2" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small", keypair "test_key" in security groups "smoketest2"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance2" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance2" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance2" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Start 3rd instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance3" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small", keypair "test_key" in security groups "smoketest3"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance3" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance3" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance3" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance3" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance3" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


# Creating rules and checking traffic  ---------------


    Scenario: Add rule to allow all traffic from SG2 pass to SG3
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see security group "smoketest2" exist
        And I see security group "smoketest3" exist
        When I add rule allow from group "smoketest2", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "smoketest3"
        And I add rule allow from group "smoketest3", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "smoketest2"
        Then I see rule allow from group "smoketest2", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "smoketest3" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "smoketest3", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "smoketest2" exist

    Scenario: Login to 2nd instance and check traffic can pass to 3rd instance and cannot pass to 1st
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"

            |  Command                |   Expected  |
            |   ping -c3 "rhelinstance3" \| grep received \|awk '{print $4}'   |   3      |

        And I login to VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command                |   Expected  |
            |   ping -c3 "rhelinstance1" \| grep received \|awk '{print $4}'   |   0      |



    Scenario: Login to 3rd instance and check traffic can pass to 2nd instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance3" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"

            |   ping -c3 "rhelinstance2" \| grep received \|awk '{print $4}'   |   3      |


    Scenario: Remove rule to allow all traffic from SG2 pass to SG3
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see security group "smoketest2" exist
