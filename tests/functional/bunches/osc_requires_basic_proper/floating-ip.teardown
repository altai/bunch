Feature: Remove pool of external IP's
    In order to clean after test of floating IP feature
    As tester
    I want to remove pool of external IP's using nova-manage


    Scenario: Deregister pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28" exist
        When I remove pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28" does not exist
