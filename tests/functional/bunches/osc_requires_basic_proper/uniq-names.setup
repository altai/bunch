Feature: Change uniq-names flag and check it works
    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
    As tester

    Scenario: Enable uniq names flag in nova.conf
        Then every service is running:
                                      | ServiceName   |
                                      
                                      | nova-api |
                                      
                                      | nova-direct-api |
                                      
                                      | nova-compute |
                                      
                                      | nova-network |
                                      
                                      | nova-scheduler |
                                      
                                      | glance-api |
                                      
                                      | glance-registry |
                                      
        When I change flag file "/etc/nova/nova.conf" by setting flag values:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | true  |
        And I restart services:
                                      |     ServiceName    |
                                      
                                      | nova-api        |
                                      
                                      | nova-direct-api        |
                                      
                                      | nova-compute        |
                                      
                                      | nova-network        |
                                      
                                      | nova-scheduler        |
                                      
                                      | glance-api        |
                                      
                                      | glance-registry        |
                                      


    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
            |  Command                            | Expected  |
            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |
