Feature: Deregister SSH keys using  python-novaclient CLI
    In order to have access to VM instances
    As tester
    I want to deregister SSH keys via python-novaclient CLI tools

    Scenario: Deregister existing keypair
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I remove keypair with name "test_key"
        Then I see keypair "test_key" does not exists
