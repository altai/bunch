Feature: Check keystone service
    In order to smoke test keystone functionality
    As root
    I want to create user, tenant, endpoints in keystone

    Scenario: Check user creating using keystone
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |
            
            | nova-direct-api |
            
            | nova-compute |
            
            | nova-network |
            
            | nova-scheduler |
            
            | glance-api |
            
            | glance-registry |
            
            | keystone |
        When I create keystone user "admin1" with password "secrete" in tenant "project1"
        Then I see keystone user "admin1" exist

    Scenario: Grant permission for keystone user
        Given I see keystone user "admin1" exist
        When I grant role "Admin" for keystone user "admin1"
        Then I see role "Admin" granted for keystone user "admin1"

    Scenario: Create token
        Given I see keystone user "admin1" exist
        When I create token "111333555777" for keystone user "admin1" in tenant "project1"
        Then I see token "111333555777" for keystone user "admin1" in tenant "project1" exist
