Feature: Remove services installed to test nova volumes
    In order to test volume functionality
    As tester
    I want to remove services


    Scenario: Stop iscsi and nova-volume services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        When I stop services:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | tgtd |
            
            
            | nova-volume |
            
        Then every service is stopped:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | tgtd |
            
            
            | nova-volume |
            

    Scenario: Remove created volumes
        Given every service is stopped:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | tgtd |
            
        When I remove lvm group "nova-volumes" on device "/dev/loop4"
        And I remove loop device "/dev/loop4"
        Then I see lvm group "nova-volumes" on device "/dev/loop4" removed
        And I see loop device "/dev/loop4" removed




# BAD Idea. Removes all openstack
#    Scenario: Remove packages
#        Given current user can execute sudo without password
#        When I remove RPM package(s):
#            | PackageName   |
#            
#            | scsi-target-utils |
#            
#            | lvm2 |
#            
#        Then every RPM package is not installed:
#            | PackageName   |
#            
#            | scsi-target-utils |
#            
#            | lvm2 |
#
