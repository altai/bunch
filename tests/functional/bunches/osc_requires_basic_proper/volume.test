Feature: Test nova volume
    In order to smoke test Volume functionality
    As tester
    I want to start instance, create volume and test it can be used within instance

    Scenario: Start instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance1" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small" and keypair "test_key"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance1" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Create volume
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-volume |
            
        When I create volume "vol" with size of "1" in zone "nova"
        Then volume "vol" comes up within "180" seconds

    Scenario: Attach volume to instance
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see volume "vol" available
        When I attach volume "vol" to VM instance "rhelinstance1" as device "/dev/vdc"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command                                          |   Expected  |
            | dmesg \| tail -20                                 |  noFail  |
            | cat /proc/diskstats                               |  noFail  |
        Then I see volume "vol" attached to VM instance "rhelinstance1"

    Scenario: Check volume is accessible inside instance
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see volume "vol" attached to VM instance "rhelinstance1"
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I login to VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            | dmesg \|tail -20                                       |  noFail  |
            | cat /proc/diskstats                                    |  noFail  |
            | /sbin/mke2fs /dev/vdc                                  |  noFail  |
            | mkdir  /tmp/nova-volume-test                                  |  noFail  |
            | mount -t ext2 /dev/vdc /tmp/nova-volume-test                  |  noFail  |
            | grep   /tmp/nova-volume-test /proc/mounts \| awk '{print $1}' |  /dev/vdc  |
            | mkdir  /tmp/nova-volume-test/testDir                          |  noFail  |
            | touch  /tmp/nova-volume-test/testDir/testFile                 |  noFail  |
            | umount /tmp/nova-volume-test                                  |  noFail  |
            | mount -t ext2 /dev/vdc /tmp/nova-volume-test                  |  noFail  |
            | ls -1  /tmp/nova-volume-test/testDir/                         |  testFile  |
            | umount /tmp/nova-volume-test                                  |  noFail  |
        Then commands are executed without errors

    Scenario: Detach volume
        Given I see volume "vol" attached to VM instance "rhelinstance1"
        When I detach volume "vol"
        Then I see volume "vol" available

    Scenario: Start second instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance2" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small" and keypair "test_key"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance2" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance2" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance2" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"


    Scenario: Attach volume to second instance
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance2" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see volume "vol" available
        When I attach volume "vol" to VM instance "rhelinstance2" as device "/dev/vdc"
        Then I see volume "vol" attached to VM instance "rhelinstance2"

    Scenario: Check volume data saved and can be accessible on second instance
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance2" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see volume "vol" attached to VM instance "rhelinstance2"
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I login to VM "rhelinstance2" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
