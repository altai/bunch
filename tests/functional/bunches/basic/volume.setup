Feature: Install, start services and create virtual disk needed to test volume
    In order to test volume functionality
    As tester
    I want to install services


    Scenario: Start iscsi and nova-volumes services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I start services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
