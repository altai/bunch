Feature: Remove services installed to test nova volumes
    In order to test volume functionality
    As tester
    I want to remove services


    Scenario: Stop iscsi and nova-volume services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        When I stop services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is stopped:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}



# BAD Idea. Removes all openstack
#    Scenario: Remove packages
#        Given current user can execute sudo without password
#        When I remove RPM package(s):
#            | PackageName   |
#            {% for package in volume_packages %}
#            | {{ package }} |
#            {% endfor %}
#        Then every RPM package is not installed:
#            | PackageName   |
#            {% for package in volume_packages %}
#            | {{ package }} |
#            {% endfor %}
