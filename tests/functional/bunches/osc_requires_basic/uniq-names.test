Feature: Change uniq-names flag and check it works
    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
    As tester

    Scenario: Enable uniq names flag in nova.conf
        Then every service is running:
                                      | ServiceName   |

        When I change flag file "/etc/nova/nova.conf" by setting flag values:

                                      | --project_uniq_names | true  |

#Feature: Check uniq names feature
#    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
#    As tester
#    I want to register start instance and verify it is up and available. Check i can not start instance with same name

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-network ! novaclient-images ! novaclient-keys"

    Scenario: Start multiple instances with same name when unique instance names enabled
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And the following flags in file "/etc/nova/nova.conf" are set to:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | true  |

        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance1" using image "solid_mini_image", flavor "m1.small"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" comes up within "180" seconds


    Scenario: Check we can not start instancr with same name
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
# TODO
        Then I can not start VM instance "rhelinstance1" using image "solid_mini_image", flavor "m1.small"


    Scenario: Stop instances after test
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        When I stop VM instance "rhelinstance1"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" is stopped within "180" seconds
