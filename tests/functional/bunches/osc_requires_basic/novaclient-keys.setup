Feature: Register SSH keys using  python-novaclient CLI
    In order to have access to VM instances
    As tester
    I want to register SSH keys via python-novaclient CLI tools


    Scenario: Register existing keypair from file
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        When I generate keypair saving it to file "id_rsa_generated"
        And I add keypair with name "test_key" from file "id_rsa_generated.pub"
        Then keypair with name "test_key" exists
