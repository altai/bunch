Feature: Create user and project using python-novaclient CLI
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As cloud admin
    I want to register images

#    Scenario: Upload, unpack and register image from url
#        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
#        And VM image tarball is available at "http://osc-build.vm.griddynamics.net/images/rhel_image.tar.gz"
#        When I download VM image tarball at "http://osc-build.vm.griddynamics.net/images/rhel_image.tar.gz" and unpack it
##        And using glance I register VM image "rhel_image" for owner "admin1" using disk "rootfs.raw", ram "initramfs-2.6.32-131.0.15.el6.x86_64.img", kernel "vmlinuz-2.6.32-131.0.15.el6.x86_64"
#        And using nova-manage I register VM image "rhel_image" for owner "admin1" using disk "rootfs.raw", ram "initramfs-2.6.32-131.0.15.el6.x86_64.img", kernel "vmlinuz-2.6.32-131.0.15.el6.x86_64"
#        Then VM image "rhel_image" is registered

    Scenario: Upload and register solid images
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image tarball is available at "http://osc-build.vm.griddynamics.net/images/mini_image.img"
        When I download VM image tarball at "http://osc-build.vm.griddynamics.net/images/mini_image.img"
        And using nova-manage I register VM image "solid_mini_image" for owner "admin1" using disk "mini_image.img"
        Then VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
