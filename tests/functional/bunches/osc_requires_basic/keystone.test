Feature: Setup keystone on installed OpenStack
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As root
    I want to setup keystone

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-keys"

    Scenario: Install keystone
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            
            | libvirt      |
            
            | mysql      |

        And every RPM package available:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        When I install RPM package(s):
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        Then every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |

        And I init keystone db for IP "172.18.40.10", admin "admin1", password "secrete", project "project1", token "111333555777", region "kRegion"

        And I start services:
            | ServiceName        |
            | keystone |
        And I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |

            | glance-registry |
            
            | keystone |

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:

            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |

#Feature: Check keystone service
#    In order to smoke test keystone functionality
#    As root
#    I want to create user, tenant, endpoints in keystone

    Scenario: Check user creating using keystone
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            
            | nova-api |

            | glance-registry |
            
            | keystone |
        When I create keystone user "admin1" with password "secrete" in tenant "project1"
        Then I see keystone user "admin1" exist

    Scenario: Grant permission for keystone user
        Given I see keystone user "admin1" exist
        When I grant role "Admin" for keystone user "admin1"
        Then I see role "Admin" granted for keystone user "admin1"

    Scenario: Create token
        Given I see keystone user "admin1" exist
        When I create token "111333555777" for keystone user "admin1" in tenant "project1"
        Then I see token "111333555777" for keystone user "admin1" in tenant "project1" exist


#Feature: Remove keystone

#    As root
#    I want to remove keystone


    Scenario: Revert changes made to nova and glance
