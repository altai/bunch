Feature: Add pool of external IP's
    In order to have test floating IP feature
    As tester
    I want to Add pool of external IP's using nova-manage

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-images ! novaclient-keys"

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |


    Scenario: Register pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        When I add pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28" exist

#Feature: Allocate external IP and associate with instance,
#    In order to test floating IP feature
#    As tester
#    I want to associate external IP with instance


    Scenario: Allocate external IP
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28" exist
        When I allocate address "floatip"
        Then I see address "floatip" allocated


    Scenario: Start instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM image "solid_mini_image" is registered
        And keypair with name "test_key" exists
        When I start VM instance "rhelinstance1" using image "solid_mini_image",  flavor "m1.small" and keypair "test_key"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" comes up within "180" seconds
        And VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "rhelinstance1" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "90" seconds
        And I can log into VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated"
        And I login to VM "rhelinstance1" via SSH as "root" with key "id_rsa_generated" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |

    Scenario: Associate allocated IP with started instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        When I associate address "floatip" with instance "rhelinstance1"
        Then I see address "floatip" associated with instance "rhelinstance1"

    Scenario: Check floating IP
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        When I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT                       | noFail    |
        Then address "floatip" is pingable within "90" seconds




## CLEAN AFTER TEST ----------------------

    Scenario: De-associate IP from instance
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see address "floatip" associated with instance "rhelinstance1"
        When I de-associate address "floatip" from instance "rhelinstance1"
        Then I see address "floatip" not associated with instance "rhelinstance1"
        And I see address "floatip" allocated


    Scenario: De-Allocate external IP
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see address "floatip" allocated
        When I de-allocate address "floatip"
        Then I see address "floatip" not allocated


    Scenario: Stop instance
        Given VM instance "rhelinstance1" is pingable within "90" seconds
        When I stop VM instance "rhelinstance1"
        Then VM instance "rhelinstance1" is stopped within "180" seconds

    Scenario: Undo system changes
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        When I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT                       | noFail    |
        Then commands are executed without errors

#Feature: Remove pool of external IP's
#    In order to clean after test of floating IP feature
#    As tester
#    I want to remove pool of external IP's using nova-manage


    Scenario: Deregister pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "project1", user "admin1" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28" exist
        When I remove pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "172.30.254.0/28" does not exist
